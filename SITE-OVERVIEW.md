# Rejuvenate Health MKE - Site Overview

## 🎨 Logo Design

I created a clean, modern logo with:
- **Symbol**: Abstract wellness mark with flowing curves representing health/rejuvenation
- **Colors**: Navy blue (#2C5F6F) and Teal (#7AB8A8)
- **Typography**: Clean, professional sans-serif
- **Style**: Minimal, medical-appropriate, scales well

The logo appears in the top-left of every page and works on any background.

## 💡 What Makes This Different from WordPress/Elementor

**Advantages**:
1. **Faster**: No WordPress overhead, loads instantly
2. **Simpler**: No plugins to manage, no updates to break things
3. **Cheaper**: Free hosting on Netlify (vs. paying for WordPress hosting)
4. **More secure**: No database, fewer attack vectors
5. **Better SEO**: Cleaner code, faster loading
6. **You have help**: I can modify anything instantly vs. wrestling with page builders

**Trade-offs**:
- No visual editor (but you have me to make changes)
- More "manual" for updates (but with Netlify + Git, it's automated)

For a site this size with defined pages, this approach is actually BETTER than WordPress.
